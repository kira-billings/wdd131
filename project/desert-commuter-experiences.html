        <p>I can say I have seen my fair share of a burning vehicles during my commutes. It is also really sad when there is new evidences of crashes on the road. You can trace the tire track marks from one side of the lane, over to the inner cement blockade and back to the other side of the road, ending in large blackened patch of roadway. There must have been a story behind that one. The next week, a memorial cross shows up and I pray for their loved ones left behind.

        <h3 id="flood">Flood</h3>
        <p> Wind is a threat occasionally, but the most alarming threats are monsoon thunder storms in late summer which can flood the road. In the summer of 2025 a particularly heavy storm caused mud and rocks to cover the entire freeway near exit 93 in Moapa. I saw the damage to the road and the piles of dirt and gravel pushed to the median between the north and south bound lanes. The north bound lanes are lower than southbound and so all the water from the hill gets funneled to the left lane of northbound. Going up the hill you can see the course of the temporary river that eroded the median.

        <h3 id="fresh-air">Fresh Air</h3>
        <p>When driving through the Apex area of Nevada, change your air source to recirculation instead of fresh air from outside the car. The landfill nearby has some strange smells that will pervade the area for many miles. In fact, don't use the outside air intake at all from Exit 75 to Las Vegas because of air pollution if you can help it. Only in times of defrosting and feeling tired from excess carbon dioxide should it be necessary to use the outside air intake while driving through these areas. From St. George to exit 75 you are good to open the windows or intake fresh air without the air pollution or landfill smells.

        <p>I feel I need to shout out to the Arizona Department of Public Safety for heavily patrolling the small section of my commute that goes through your tiny corner of AZ. You are keeping us safe! One of your favorite spots is right at the border behind the crest of the hill so northbound drivers can't see you until they have crossed from NV to AZ. Thank you AZDPS! Honorable mention goes to the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP) who does the same thing at the AZ/UT border. It's like you have this coordinated. Nevada State Police? We love you too. I hope you get to sleep in every week-day until about 6:15 am. </p>

        <p>There are no words to describe the beauty of the mountains and sky when the sun and clouds create ever changing scenes of light, contrast, and color that will take your breath away. Sunrise and sunset with rain clouds will cause you to weep with joy - the best thing about this commute during dawn and dusk hours.</p>

        <h3 id="no-where">No Where Else To Go</h3>
        <p>Out in the desert there are no side streets to take a detour. When there was construction delays just south of Mesquite on a Friday evening before a the 4th of July, the traffic was backed up for 20 miles with a bottleneck that took an hour to get through. You may be tempted to do some off-roading on that dirt road that runs right next to the freeway. Don't do it! It is a dead end where the road falls off into a ravine. You will have to turn around and drive for miles to get back on the freeway and your car will be covered in red dust as evidence of your poor decision making and impatience. Even if you see others do it or if your maps says there is a road, you will regret it.

        <p>In January of 2026, just outside of Mesquite, there was a rare early morning crash with 2 semi-trucks and a passenger vehicle that caused thousands of pounds of potatoes to be scattered across the roadway. It had just happened and the authorities hadn't even arrived yet. They had pulled aside some of the vehicles to make room for thru traffic so we could drive through, smashing the potatoes. That potato stain on the roadway will be there until it rains but at least it isn't permanent like the fiery burn marks from other crashes.

        <h3 id="virgin-gorge">Virgin Gorge</h3>
        <p>If this is your first time driving the Virgin River Canyon (aka "The Gorge"), you might be really nervous, and white knuckle the entire way, because of the tight curves and steep grades. Do NOT look at the scenery as you will quickly find out that there is no room for error or distraction in this drive. 

          This 29 mile stretch of freeway held a national record of the most expensive roadway ever built when it was finished in 1973 = equivalent to 300 million dollars in today's money. To carve a path through the canyon’s sheer walls, crews literally dangled from ropes to set charges — it’s one of the reasons this stretch is considered an engineering marvel. They had to reroute the river 12 times, although today, construction crews are not allowed to touch the river. Now, maintenance is unusually complicated and expensive. With blasting prohibitions, years of construction can cause massive traffic bottlenecks and millions of dollars.  
          
          The canyon itself is 500 million years old. With the adrenaline inducing speeds and the light and shadows ever changing, this part of the commute deserves the highest honors. You will never grow tired or bored while driving through this section of the freeway. 
          
          I normally drive in the left lane in both directions while going through the gorge because the right lane is more damaged from the constant semi-truck traffic and there is a risk of cars pulling out in front of you. Always be prepared to stop at any moment while driving the gorge. Speaking from experience. I almost hit a stalled vehicle in the left lane and came within inches. And then I was terrified someone would crash in behind me. I was miraculously protected though, as I was safely able to drive around the vehicle and go home. Stay alert and slow down.
